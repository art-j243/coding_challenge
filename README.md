## Hangman Coding Challenge in Python
### Arthur Carter

This was written for a computer programmer job application at BYU. Notes regarding my process are commented into my python file. No external libraries were used. The program succesfully runs in the terminal with all the requirements completed along with the "exta credit."

This code took me a total of 2 hours and 56 minutes.

Thank you for your consideration!
